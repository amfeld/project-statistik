# Project Financial Analytics

## What does this do?

This feature automatically calculates money-related information for your projects. It shows you how much money you've made, spent, and whether your project is profitable or losing money.

## What information does it calculate?

For each project, it calculates:

- **Bills to Customers**: How much you've invoiced customers for this project
- **Money Actually Received**: How much customers have actually paid you
- **Bills from Vendors**: How much is invoiced suppliers/vendors for this project
- **Task Costs**: Money spent on project tasks and activities
- **Total Project Costs**: All expenses combined (bills + task costs)
- **Profit or Loss**: Whether you're making money or losing money on the project
- **Outstanding Amount**: How much money you're still owed by customers

## How does it work?

1. **Finds the Customer**: Looks at who the project is for
2. **Counts Customer Invoices**: Adds up all invoices sent to that customer
3. **Checks Payments**: Sees which invoices have been paid
4. **Adds Vendor Bills**: Includes all bills you've paid for supplies/services
5. **Includes Task Costs**: Adds costs from project tasks and time tracking
6. **Does the Math**: Calculates profit by subtracting costs from income

## When does it run?

The calculations happen automatically when you:
- Open the accounting dashboard
- View project lists from accounting screens
- The system needs up-to-date financial information

## What you see as results

After calculation, each project shows:
- Total invoiced amount
- Total paid amount  
- Vendor bills total
- Net costs (without tax)
- Total costs (with tax)
- Profit/loss amount
- Any negative differences (losses)

## Simple Example

**Project ABC:**
- Invoiced customer: $10,000
- Customer paid: $8,000
- Vendor bills: $3,000
- Task costs: $2,000
- **Result: Profit of $3,000** ($10,000 - $3,000 - $2,000 - $2,000 tax)

This helps you quickly see which projects are making money and which ones need attention!
